# Dataquest-Guided-Project-Star-Wars-Survey-
This Dataquest guided project is based on answering an important question in Jupyter Notebook style. From Dataquest:
'''
Does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?
The team needed to collect data addressing this question. 
To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. 
They received 835 total responses, which you download from their GitHub repository.
